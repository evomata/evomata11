# evomata11
The 11th cellular automata created with the sole purpose of creating emergent phenomena through evolution.
Uses a gray-scott reaction diffusion equation along with genetic algorithms.

### A moderately high spawn density with movement cost 0 simulated for a while.

### After optimizations, at movement cost of 0, very interesting competition going on.

### Evomata11 equivalent of a Venus Fly Trap.

### Movement cost of 50. Cells can produce signals now and can diffuse differently on each side.

### Movement cost around 150, moderate population (due to food) density.

### Dying cells release food, cells can explode to kill enemies, signaling chemicals are added.
